Composum Platform Auth provides an authentication module for the Composum Platform using OpenID authentication using
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). This module supports various identity providers such as Google and Facebook. When
a new user logs in, an account is automatically created in the Sling JCR and can be given access to protected content or
authoring through the User Manager or workflows in the tenant module. The module also includes features for session ID
transport and handling multiple virtual hosts. You can observe it in action at [cloud.composum.com](https://cloud.
composum.com).
